      <p>Flat fees mean that the exchange charges the taker and the maker the same fee. When it comes to decentralized
        exchanges, many of them don't charge any trading fees at all. This is in fact one of the big arguments that
        DEX-supporters use to explain why centralized exchanges are on their way out. Synapse Bridge is not one of the "no fee"
        exchanges funds, but charge 0.20% per transaction regardless of whether you are a maker or a taker.</p>
